## BCI and Gaze-Controlled VR Game

### Overview
This project explores the integration of gaze tracking and steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) technology to create an immersive and accessible virtual reality gaming experience. Players engage with moving targets - robots adorned with flickering dots - by fixating their gaze on a target, causing their brain signals to synchronize with the flickering frequency and triggering the destruction of the object in-game.

### Key Features
- Seamless integration of gaze tracking and SSVEP detection for enhanced accuracy and reliability
- Customization options to adjust flickering light frequencies and colors for individual accessibility
- Advanced signal processing techniques like notch filtering, Fast Fourier Transform, and Recursive Least Squares adaptive filtering to enhance SSVEP detection from EEG data
- Support Vector Machine model for supervised learning to differentiate SSVEP signals from background EEG activity

### Tools and APIs
- Unity Game Engine, Version 2022.3.14f1
- Varjo VR Headset with Varjo Unity Package and Varjo Base
- OpenBCI Cyton 8-Channel EEG Cap
- PhysiolabXR and Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)

### Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Unity Game Engine 2022.3.14f1
3. Set up Varjo VR Headset and OpenBCI Cyton 8-Channel EEG Cap
